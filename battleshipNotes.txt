ClientGUI is going to require a lot of rewriting; there's a lot of stuff in there (Client-Server interaction) that should be in a different class.

Server, of course, will require some work, esp. for threading/net code.

Another class, possibly called Client (or just Battleship), will be needed to actually talk to the server.
