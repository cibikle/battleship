ClientGUI is going to require a lot of rewriting; there's a lot of stuff in there (Client-Server interaction) that should be in a different class.

For another thing, I'd like to change his messages to something more... better.  Succinct, professional.  Something.

Server, of course, will require some work, esp. for threading/net code.

Another class, possibly called Client (or just Battleship), will be needed to actually talk to the server.

Actually using the ServerGlobalMap, Coordinates, Ship, and ShipList classes is going to be interesting; I can't wait to find out what all I got wrong.
